*Alexander E, Ioana C, Joaquin B Q, Johan H, Theodor M

### Introduction
The program is a CI server. It's best friends with Travis.

### Background

This is the second assignment in the course Software Engineering Fundamentals (DD2480) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

### Tech/Framework used

Language: Java 8
Build tool: Maven 3.6.3 by the CI, Maven 4 for the CI

### RUN
step 1: mvn compile
step 2: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=Main

### Test
TODO

### Development history
We started by creating the code skeleton for the project and a gitignore that got lost. With the provided Jetty configuration we split the work and pair-programmed the compile and clone functionalities using the jGit API and Maven Invoker. Afterwards we merged the branches together and did some more stuff. Then we created a mock-up project to test the functionality of the CI server. We also whote tests for the mock-up in order to test that functionality as well. At the same time the e-mail link was wrote in order for the server to notify the user of the build success. rest is TODO
