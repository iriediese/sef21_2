### RUN
TODO

### Test
TODO

### Development history
We started by creating the code skeleton for the project and a gitignore that got lost. With the provided jetti configuration we split the work and pairprogrammed the compile and clone functionality using the jGit API and Maven Invoker. Afterwards we merged the branches together and did some more stuff. Then we created a mock-up project to test the functionality of the CI server. We also whote tests for the mock-up in order to test that fungtionality aswell. At the same time the e-mail link was written in order for the server to notify the user of the build succes. rest is TODO
